# -----
2017-06-19, roveda
  ora_grants.pl: Ignoring temporary compression advisor tables when granting privilges.

2017-06-01, roveda
  Changed the header of crontab_create.sh

2017-04-04, roveda
  Merged the NLS parameters into one table in ora_dbinfo.pl.

2017-03-20, roveda
  Fixed ora_housekeeping.pl: the age in 'purge -age' must be minutes, 
  now the number of days are recalculated to minutes.
  Implemented workaround for Oracle bug concerning adr_base which is
  NOT derived from diagnostic_dest but from a central file in ORACLE_HOME.
  Therefore not correct if multiple instance are present on one server.
  Fixed the broken support of sid specific configuration file in all perl scripts.

2017-03-14, roveda
  Fixed the double transmission of the script and version to ULS in ora_statspack.pl.

2017-02-14, roveda
  Changed "Versions" to new format.

2017-02-07, roveda
  Added a signal handler to all perl scripts. That is called e.g. if the  
  server is shut down during a backup. The script will try to clean up and 
  send all current ULS values to the ULS server.

2017-02-01, roveda
  Rewritten all scripts as preparation for building an rpm for some time.
  Finally built rpm package oracle-optools.

2017-01-11, roveda
  Changed inventory composition in ora_dbinfo.pl, added ip address, 
  added some parameters, added some text, added some style.

2016-06-29, roveda
  Changed crontab_create.sh

2016-06-27, roveda
  Changed crontab_create.sh

2016-06-19, roveda
  Changed HtmlDocument.pm, added a 'force' parameter to save2file().

2016-06-15, roveda
  Added the output of the ORA- lines to the message of the orarman script.
  That allows faster identification of failure reasons.

2016-06-14, roveda
  Added the mode expression to the WORKFILEPREFIX for ora_statspack.pl
  Coincidently running both SNAPSHOT and REPORT may lead to errors during execution, 
  because workfilenames were the same. Temporary output was overwritten by
  the second script.

2016-06-09, roveda
  Added the DBID to the inventory output in ora_dbinfo.pl

2016-03-23, roveda
  Changed orarman.pl: the used parameter (FULL, LEVEL0, REDOLOGS) is sent as detail(!) to ULS, 
  a value of 0 indicates an error, a 1 success. 
  That allows a math-based monitoring of backup execution over different levels.
  The WORKFILEPREFIX is now instance(SID)-safe.

2016-03-22, roveda
  Made the get_config2() in Misc.pm safe to read files without any sections.
  The perl scripts exited when trying to read the initially empty oracle_tools_SID.conf file.

2016-03-21, roveda
  Made the oracle_tools.conf read-only, because non-standard parameters should be 
  defined in an oracle_tools_SID.conf file. That allows better and more reliable
  automatic updates of the oracle_tools.

2016-03-18, roveda
  Changed the loop in backup_redologs
  Changed the command to retrieve the hostname for default ULS_HOSTNAME in oracle_tools.conf

2016-03-18, roveda
  Changed all .pl to support a second, ORACLE_SID-specific configuration file.
  That is the preparation for fully automatic updates of the oracle_tools:
  All defaults are defined in oracle_tools.conf, if you need any other settings, 
  you create an oracle_tools_$ORACLE_SID.conf file which ONLY contains the 
  deviant sections and parameters (do not forget the section!).

  Changed nightly to remove outdated .tmp files from oracle_tools directory.

  oracle_tools_D_2016-03-18.zip packaged in d_oracle_inst

2016-03-10, roveda
  oracle_tools_D_2016-03-10.zip packaged in d_oracle_inst

2016-02-11, roveda

2016-02-03, roveda
  ora_dbinfo.pl: removed detailed feature usage from inventory.
  backup_redologs: try a second execution if the first one fails.

2015-02-12, roveda
  Debugged scheduler_details() in watch_oracle.pl
  Added 'exit value' to all perl scripts, sends a '0' if "OK", else a '1'.
  That is intended for combined limits such as: if more than two of the last 
  three executions have failed, then send a notification.

2015-01-29, roveda
  oracle_tools_D_2015-01-29 shipped.

2015-01-21, roveda
  instance_start now starts the listener first, then the database. 
  It should be registered at once.

2015-01-07, roveda
  Added the --silent option to crontab_create.sh. That suppresses all output. 
  The general advices for following commands do probably not comply to the 
  user's installation procedure, so make them optional.

  oracle_tools_D_2015-01-07 shipped.

2014-12-14, roveda
  Got errors when using ora_grants on schemata which got synonyms on remote tables via a database link.
  ORA-02021: DDL operations are not allowed on a remote database

  oracle_tools_D_2014-11-24 shipped.

2014-11-18, roveda

  No, changed the nightly script back to full and incremental backup.
